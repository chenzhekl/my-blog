Hi, I am a Ph.D. student at Computer Vision Laboratory, Kyoto University, where I am supervised by Ko Nishino. I got my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University in 2018. My research interests are mainly in inverse rendering, computational photography, and machine learning.
